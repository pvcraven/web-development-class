   those skills are important and how they add value.
2. What dispositions (qualities of mind and character) help achieve a shared
   goal?
3. For your project, describe how these skills were applied as part of the
   project. Be specific. What skill, and how was it applied.
4. As different people have different strengths and weaknesses, describe how
   you used this knowledge to better collaborate.
5. What skills and dispositions do you think are the most important for you to
   improve on? How would you go about doing that?
6. In the case of group projects where the group does not work well together,
   explain your role in helping to improve the collaboration. What common
   mistakes to people make that hurt collaboration efforts?
