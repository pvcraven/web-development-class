Assignment 7 - Security Report
==============================

Goal
----

Write a report detailing application security.

Attack Vectors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Directory Traversal / Poisoned File Upload
* SQL Injection
* Cross-site scripting / HTML injection
* Denial-of-Service
* Distributed Denial-of-Service - cite that book
* Brute Force Password Attack, or other parameters
* Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards
* Known Vulnerabilities
* Social Engineering

How to Secure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Proper encoding of JSON data, HTML data, SQL data
* Firewall
* Authentication vs. Authorization
* Server certificates
* Running process security
* Data validation
* Data encoding
* Two-Factor Authentication
* Encryption
* Hashing

Next, look at our own application that can insert and display records. See
if you can do SQL injections or cross-site scripting.

This report will go through three phases. A draft phase, a review phase, and then
the final copy.
