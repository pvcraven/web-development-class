Assignment 7 - PHP Include
==========================

Take the project you have on your own web server, and modify it to use the PHP
include statement.

1. Get your own copy of the project, from the last assignment, working on your
   computer under XAMPP. You should be able to get to it from ``http://localhost``
2. Put the navigation in a common file. Reference the navigation file from all the
   main pages that need it. You'll need to change files like ``index.html`` to
   ``index.php`` for the PHP ``include`` to work.
3. Put the footer in a common file. Reference the footer file from all the
   main pages that need it.
4. Use CSE Validator to check your entire website. Do *not* check your individual
   files as they exist on the disk. Check your actual web site.

Turn in:

* A link to your web site's AWS server where this is working. Don't give me
  a "localhost" or "file" link, obviously.
* A link to the GitHub project on the web, showing the index.php file
  . (A link to the web page,
  not a link to clone it.) Make sure it is a link to YOUR GitHub, not
  someone else's.
