Assignment 8 - DNS and Performance
==================================

Turn in a document saved in MS Word format. Make sure you include name,
date, and title at the top. Just like you should for any assignment for this
class.

Don't forget to use paragraphs. Don't give me a wall of text please.

Part 1
------

Summarize what the DNS is, how to register a domain, and how a domain name
is resolved.

I'll go over this in class, so if you take good notes, you'll have part 1 done.
A good explanation will likely run about one page, double-spaced.

Part 2
------

Use `WebPageTest <https://www.webpagetest.org/>`_ on two different web pages.

* Your web site you created with AWS
* One other website that you found, which has performance issues. Do not pick
  a fast website like Google's search page.

Explain what WebPageTest shows, and also talk about how to improve the performance.
Spend some time with this. Figure out what is making the website slow.
How would you improve it? It will probably take at least one page. I've had people
take six pages.

I'll do this in class with Hy-Vee. Your assignment is to do it with two more web
pages.

Feel free to use the 'snip' tool or similar to take and explain parts of the
results. Your explanation should be about 3/4 of a page or more for each
site and pull out exact examples of what is slow. For example, tell me how
many requests were made, what the biggest image was, if there was a lot of JavaScript, etc.
