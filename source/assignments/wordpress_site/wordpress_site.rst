    * Visit your site, confirm the pages are showing up in the navigation bar.
    * Add at least new page (or reorganize a page that exists) and give it a
      "parent" page. You can do this on the right side while editing a page.
    * Verify you now have a drop-down menu with the pages.

    * Figure out how to use the page editor, how to upload media, and recreate
      the pages from your original website.

      can also click a "text" tab and edit the HTML directly.
