Assignment 9 - Install WordPress
================================

Using your AWS server, follow the :ref:`InstallWordpress`.

Name your site the same as the project you already have on AWS.

Turn in a URL of your working WordPress site.
It should look something like::

	http://myserver.com/wordpress/

It is not unusual to run into password issues when doing the installation
of WordPress. There are instructions at the end of the tutorial on how
to get around this. It takes time, so make sure you do this early enough
you can drop by the professor's office if things don't work.

This assignment is necessary to get the next assignment done.

Seriously, please be sure to allocate time to drop by the professor's office if needed to get things
working.
