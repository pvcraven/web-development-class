Assignment 11 - SVG
===================

Create an a web page with an embedded SVG drawing. The drawing must be:

* Generated by hand. Do not use Illustraitor or Inkscape or similar.
* A cohesive image. Abstract circles and rectangles won't score well. A house
  is better.
* Use multiple types of SVG drawing commands.
  See `SVG Intro at W3Schools <https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp>`_/
* Be detailed. A ten-line drawing won't go far in the detail. The rubric category
  for detail is only an estimate. 40 lines of code that only draw a grid of lines
  isn't very complex, despite hitting the line count. Also, I'm only looking
  at the number of lines for the image. Lines for the web page, blank lines,
  comments, don't count.
* Use color.
