Assignment 8 - DNS and Performance
==================================

Turn in a document saved in MS Word format. Make sure you include name,
date, and title at the top. Just like you should for any assignment for this
class.

Don't forget to use paragraphs. Don't give me a wall of text please.

Part 1
------

Summarize what the DNS is, how to register a domain, and how a domain name
is resolved.

I'll go over this in class, so if you take good notes, you'll have part 1 done.

Part 2
------

Use `WebPageTest <https://www.webpagetest.org/>`_ on two different web pages.

* Your web site you created with AWS
* One other website that you found, which has performance issues. Do not pick
  a fast website like Google's search page.

Explain what WebPageTest shows, and also talk about how to improve the performance.

I'll do this in class with Hy-Vee. Your assignment is to do it with two more web
pages.
