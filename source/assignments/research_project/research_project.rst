Final Research Project
======================

Goals
-----

* Demonstrate that you can go research, learn, understand, and apply a new technology.
* Demonstrate that you can communicate what you have learned.
* Show that you can review for content, structure, and grammar.
* Be able to listen to feedback and revise your work

Pick a Topic
------------

My suggestion is to pick one of the two following topics:

* AngularJS_: A front-end framework for working with interactive data. It is
  great for creating multi-screen input dialogs. It can help with data-binding
  so that you aren't constantly messing around with the DOM trying to update
  stuff.
* NodeJS_: A back-end framework. You can create your own web server with NodeJS.
  Finally everything can be in JavaScript.
* New ES6 Features:

.. _AngularJS: https://angularjs.org/
.. _NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/
