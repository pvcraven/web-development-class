Assignment 11 - Final Research Project
======================================

Goals
-----

* Demonstrate that you can research, learn, understand, and apply a new technology.
* Demonstrate that you can communicate what you have learned. (1500+ words)
* Show that you can review for content, structure, and grammar.
* Be able to listen to feedback and revise your work.

Pick a Topic
------------

My suggestion is to pick one of the following topics:

* AngularJS_: A front-end framework for working with interactive data. It is
  great for creating multi-screen input dialogs. It can help with data-binding
  so that you aren't constantly messing around with the DOM trying to update
  stuff.
* NodeJS_: A back-end framework. You can create your own web server with NodeJS.
  Finally everything can be in JavaScript.
* `New ES6 Features`_: What I've shown in class has been a version of JavaScript
  called ES5. There are a lot of new features with ES6. Explore those new
  features and report on them.
* `Continuous Integration`_: Show how to create a project that you can check
  into GitHub, have it automatically build. Run test scripts. Run coverage
  reports. And automatically deploy to a testing environment.

.. _AngularJS: https://angularjs.org/
.. _NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/
.. _New ES6 Features: http://es6-features.org/
.. _Continuous Integration: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration

If you pick a different topic, please get pre-approval. I picked these topics
because in talking with Simpson alumni, these have been the top suggested things
that to learn.

Angular
^^^^^^^

Tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/angular/default.asp

I'll show a demo in class on how this works.

NodeJS
^^^^^^

You can download NodeJS_ and follow one of the tutorials on-line.

Tutorial: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/

New ES6 Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compatibility: https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/

Continuous Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a sample project have have it use some of the
popular Continuous Integration Tools.

There are several here:

http://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/

I've used:

* GitHub
* AppVeyor
* Travis
* Coveralls

Phases
------

Below are the phases that we'll run through as part of this project.

Research
^^^^^^^^

First, take time to learn to understand your topic. Build a list of good
sources for citations. Follow along with the sample code they give you.
Make notes.

Second, create your own sample code. By this, I don't mean just take
their sample code and change a few variable names. I mean toss the tutorials and
samples you looked at while researching and start from scratch on your own
project.

Communicate
^^^^^^^^^^^

* First, start with the class GitHub project. Find your page.
* Next, make sure you can
  build locally so you don't have to wait for ReadTheDocs to update. That's a
  horrible, inefficient way of doing things. You can't see the error messages, and
  it takes three minutes to see your output instead of ten seconds.
* Then, create an outline of what you want to cover. Probably include things
  like:

  * What is it?
  * What would you use it for?
  * History
  * Simple sample and explanation
  * More complex sample
  * Screen shots (Use a trial of SnagIt or use the Windows snipping tool)
  * Code samples
  * Conclusion / reflection with your thoughts on using it

* Try to avoid 1st/2nd person references.
* Use citations.
* Must be at least 1,500 words.

Review
^^^^^^

We will spend class on 4/18 doing review on each other's work.

Revise
^^^^^^

You can use the feedback from 4/18 and have more time to improve your paper.
Final copy is due 4/25.

Schedule
--------

* 4/4 (work)
* 4/6 (work)
* 4/11 (research due, will be reviewing in class)
* 4/13 (communication due, will be reviewing in class)
* 4/18 (In-class, peer revision. Will be reviewing in class)
* 4/25 at 10 am Final is due. You don't have to show up for the final, but
  paper must be turned in.

Grading
-------

50 points


Rubric to be posted.
