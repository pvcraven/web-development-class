Assignment 6 - AWS Deployment
=============================

Deploy your project onto your own server.

Follow the AWS tutorial.

Turn in:

* A link to your web site. It should be on an AWS server and probably starts
  with ``http://ec2-``
* A link to the GitHub project on the web. (A link to the web page,
  not a link to clone it.) Make sure it is a link to YOUR GitHub, not
  someone else's.

.. attention::

    This assignment is needed as a base for other assignments. Don't take a zero on this assignment.


Sometimes this assignment goes smoothly, and sometimes it doesn't. Plan to spend time working with the professor
outside of class to get the deployment working. Usually we can get this working from scratch in about twenty
minutes. Less, if you have part of it done. But you have to make the effort to do this.

In past years, I've had several students take zeros on this assignment. Unfortunately this starts a downward spiral.

Mark when my office hours are. Be persistent. Get the assignment done as early as possible. Even if you are late,
keep at it.
