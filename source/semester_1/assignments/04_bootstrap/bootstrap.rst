Assignment 4 - Bootstrap
========================

Getting set up:

* Open the project you were assigned.
* Make sure you've got everything committed and pushed from the last assignment.
* Create a new branch of your project called ``bootstrap_firstname_lastname``.

Cover the following things from the rubric:

* Remove the CSS from the prior assignment.
* "Properly use template" Use the :ref:`bootstrap-template` tutorial to adapt
  all pages on the project to use Bootstrap. You will need to copy/paste out
  of the template into the pages to make sure that Bootstrap has been applied.
  **Also** make sure that the menu bar "hide" text on your page.
* "Style buttons with Bootstrap" Style all the buttons (there has to be at
  least one) with Bootstrap. Leave no button unstyled.
* "Use 12 column layout" Pick at least page, and make it into a responsive multi-column
  layout using Bootstrap. Don't simply make a container with just one column, it
  is hard to get a sense of using the layout functions with such a simple example.
* "Use Bootstrap menu bar" Put a Bootstrap menu bar on all your pages.
* "Use a Bootstrap alert" Put at least one Bootstrap alert somewhere on your page.
* "Use a Bootstrap Jumbotron" Properly use a Jumbotron at least once. Don't make
  the mistake of putting the whole page into the Jumbotron, just part of it.
* "HTML and CSS are valid" Use HTML Validator to find and fix all errors.

**Note:** A very common mistake is to not use the ``<div class="container">``, or to
not have the footer _inside_ that container. Check your page to make sure it does
not have text running to the
edge of the screen.

Also make sure you don't have blocks of text on a colored background. That is
too hard to read.
