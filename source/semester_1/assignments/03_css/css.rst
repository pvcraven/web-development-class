Assignment 3 - CSS
==================

In this assignment, each individual person will style one of the project websites
using CSS.

To complete this project:

* Find a project out of the list in the assignment page.
* Fork it using the "Fork" button on GitHub.
* Clone the project onto your desktop using ``git clone <project url>``
* You will be changing the files that are already there. Do NOT create your own folder with your
  own set of files. You can correct mistakenly named files. You can reorganize poorly organized
  files. But don't let there be two copies of the website in the project.
* Double-check the project for HTML and link errors using the HTML Validator,
  or the `W3 Validation Service <https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input>`_.
  Fix any issues. This is like real life, where you get stuck cleaning up other
  people's messes.
* Make sure all the file names are lower case, and have no spaces. Underscores
  are ok. Go back and fix links to match the case.
* Add a little bit more content to the site of your own creation. Seriously.
  You'll be graded on this. Add 5 or more items of new content. An item might
  be a new paragraph, a new image, or something similar.
* Delete those comments saying who owns the file. You own all the files now.
* Select a color scheme for your website.

  * Use color theory and tools we talked about in class. Perhaps use a
    `color wheel <https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel>`_.
  * Perhaps search through Adobe's Kuler_.

* For index.html:

  * Apply one or more in-line styles.
  * Apply one or more styles in the ``<head>``

* For all other pages:

  * Apply a stylesheet that you've created.
  * Make sure the stylesheet is a subdirectory named "css".
  * Most of your styles should be in this page.
  * Only create one stylesheet. Don't create a stylesheet for each html page. The idea
    of a stylesheet is to apply the same style across multiple pages.

* Create styles with a tag selector
* Create styles with an id selector (feel free to update HTML with ids and classes as needed)
* Create styles with a class selector
* Create borders
* Create a menu
* Find the table in the website and style it

* Common problems to avoid:

  * Blocks of text should black on white, or near-black and near-white.
    Maybe white on black. When reading text give your reader as much contrast as
    possible.
    Use color for highlights or titles.
  * Do not center blocks of text. That's very hard to read.

* Spend some time doing detail work. Make it look good.
* Revalidate the HTML.
  Validate the CSS. You can do this on-line as well with the
  `W3 CSS validation service <https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input>`_.
* Commit
* Push
* Submit the assignment in Scholar. Paste in the link to the GitHub web site for the project.
