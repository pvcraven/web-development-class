Bootstrap Tutorial
------------------

`Bootstrap`_ is a CSS and JavaScript library that can help you build a great
looking website without having to create your styles from scratch.

There are many libraries like Bootstrap available. We can't cover them all. But
we can use Bootstrap to give you the idea of what these libraries can do.

The Bootstrap website is great. For our purposes, here's an example document to
get started with.

Our first page will have a simple menu, and some text:

.. image:: example_01_wide.png
    :width: 700px
    :alt: First Web Page

Bootstrap is great at being *responsive*. It will scale and easily work on
large wide-screen monitors, and small iPhone 4's.

We can see that if we narrow our screen, the menu goes away and is replaced by
a "hamburger" style pull-down menu.

.. image:: example_01_narrow.png
    :width: 260px
    :alt: First Web Page

Here is the code behind that template:

.. _bootstrap_template:

.. literalinclude:: example_01.html
    :linenos:
    :language: html


To lean more about how to use Bootstrap:

* Look at the
  `Bootstrap Examples <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/>`_
  to see what is possible.
* Get started by using their
  `Bootstrap Quick Start <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/>`_,
  or the example above.
* Then look at their section on
  `Components <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/alerts/>`_
  to know how to use it for components. Try those out.
* Do you want an image with a caption? Checkout `Content...Figures <http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/figures/>`_

* Finally, look at their
  `grid system <http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/>`_. It is a very important
  tool for layout.
