JavaScript
==========

For detailed JavaScript tutorials, and as a great reference, see
`W3Schools JavaScript <http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp>`_ section.

Go through the JS Tutorial, and stop before you get to the JS Forms.

Here is an example I'll talk through:

Start with a web page ``test_javascript.html``:

.. literalinclude:: test_javascript.html
    :linenos:
    :language: html

In the same directory, create your JavaScript file ``test_javascript.js``:

.. literalinclude:: test_javascript.js
    :linenos:
    :language: javascript
