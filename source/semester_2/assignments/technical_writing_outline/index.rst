Out next assignment is to outline the writing assignment.

Start by:

* Create a new ``.rst`` document in your restructured text project. You
  might want to put it in a different directory.
* Create a title, clearly labeling it as the outline. Double underline it
  like normal.
* Link to your document in your main table of contents.
* Build and make sure it works.
* Copy over your bibliography, but not the annotations, just the references.
* Create a thesis statement

  * Everything should support this thesis. Even a tutorial
    needs a thesis, such as "How to program a card game in
    Python." This is what your writing is going to center on.
  * Under the title, label and define your thesis:

    .. code-block:: text

      **Thesis:** Social engineering attacks and how to harden your
      company against them.

* Start creating a multi-level out-line

  * Include where you will have code samples
  * Include where you will use references

.. code-block:: text

    **Thesis:** Tutorial for creating a platformer

    * Step 1 - Install and Open a Window

      * Installation (reference on installing PyCharm [#f1]_)
      * Open a Window (code sample how to open window)

    * Step 2 - Add Sprites

      * What is a sprite? (Reference [#f2]_)
      * Setup vs. Init
      * Sprite Lists
      * Add Sprites to the Game (code sample)

    * etc...

Do some reading and research! Get your main ideas, then
start to break it down.
