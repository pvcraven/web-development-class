Technical Writing 4: First Draft
================================

Create a first draft of your paper.

* Look for it to be around 1,600 - 2,200 words.
* Try to get as close to the 'final copy' as you can.

  * Don't let it still look like an outline.
  * Don't use a title like "Final Draft", use a title that is related to your paper.
