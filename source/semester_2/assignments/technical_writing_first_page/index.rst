Technical Writing 3: First Page
===============================

* Take your outline and copy it to a new page. This will be the page your
  expanded report goes.
* Select one of the major sections to expand out. Shoot for more than 300 words in
  the expanded section.
* Make sure to include at least one of: figure, citation, sample code.
* Use at least one sub-heading for your section.
  For your headings, use something more that "Chapter 1".
  What is the purpose of this section? People skim web pages and papers.
  The first thing they read will be headings. Let them know what is in that section.
  For example:

  .. code-block:: rst

      Selecting Basket-Weaving Supplies
      ---------------------------------

* Paragraphs. Please, please, use paragraphs.
  No one wants to read a wall of text, particularly on the web.
  For this amount of text, you probably need it broken into 4-5 paragraphs.
* Remember, paragraphs have a purpose statement, an explanation, and supporting
  evidence/examples. If you've got a good structure in your outline this should
  come easy.
