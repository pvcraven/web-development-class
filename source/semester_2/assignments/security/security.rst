Timetable
---------

This report will go through multiple phases:

* Find sources
* Outline
* Draft
* Review
* Final copy
* Quick two-minute presentation

Find Sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Find at least two sources covering your topic. On-line sources are ok, but
if you are citing them, look for something reputable. (With a publisher.)

Construct a bibliography using MLA. A URL is not a citation! For example:

* Wikipedia contributors. "Internet protocol suite." Wikipedia,
  *The Free Encyclopedia*. Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, 21 Feb. 2019. Web. 25 Feb. 2019.

Outline
^^^^^^^

Don't just start writing! Make an outline. Your outline might have topics like:

* Introduction / quick definition
* History of attack or topic
* Specific Examples
* What bad things can happen with the attack, or if it isn't secured
* What should a programmer do with this?
* Conclusion

By outlining, you should have topic sentences for each of your paragraphs.

Write a Draft
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Write a draft of the report. 600+ words, a bit more that two pages, double-spaced.
Don't forget to include the bibliography at the end. Use in-text citations as appropriate.

Review
^^^^^^

Print out two copies of your paper by Thursday. Do not put your name on the paper.
Do make sure you have a title on your paper.

Thursday we will exchange papers and review. Bring a pen.

Final Copy
^^^^^^^^^^

Take the feedback and update your paper.
