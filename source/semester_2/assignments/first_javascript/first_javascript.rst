Assignment 2 - First JavaScript Assignment
==========================================

Take the HTML code at the end of this assignment, and then write a JavaScript
file to complete the five parts. Please use jQuery where appropriate.

Four points for each part.

To get set up and turn it in:

* Create a file called ``javascript_assignment.html`` in the IntelliJ project
  you created from our last assignment.
  Put the HTML file in the "web" folder. **Don't** put it in the WEB-INF folder.
* Copy the content below into the file.
* Create a file called ``javascript_assignment.js`` in your IntelliJ project
* Rather than go through the "redeploy" process, just open the original
  source file in your web browser. When we working with the database we will
  have to go through the run/deploy process. But since we are just doing JavaScript
  we can skip that.
* Write the JavaScript to solve all five parts.
* Hover over the IntelliJ bar on the right side where there are little "suggestion"
  and error lines. See if there are any improvements in style to make.
* Build a WAR file.
* Deploy it.
* Confirm it still works. (You'll need to navigate directly to the file.)
* Paste in a GitHub link to your JavaScript, and a link to your working application
  on Amazon.
