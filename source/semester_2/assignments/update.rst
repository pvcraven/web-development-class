Hello everyone,

With COVID and malicious computer outages, things are...weird.

I'm trying to solidify what needs to be done by the end of the year,
so here we go:

CMSC 340 Computer Networks
==========================

Here we are summing up:

* Work left to be done
* Schedule
* What the final project tasks are

Work left to be done
--------------------

All due April 28 at 10 am.

* Session quiz (15 pts)
* Session projects (100 pts)
* Presentation projects (100 pts)

We do NOT have a presentation quiz.

Schedule
--------

I don't know when I'll get a computer and be able to do zoom again.
I may not be doing any more presentations. I'll just be looking for you to
get work done.

I will check off anything from the Session projects or the Presentation projects.

* Thursday, April 8 - Work and get things checked off
* Tuesday, April 13 - Work and get things checked off
* Thursday, April 15 - Work and get things checked off
* Tuesday, April 20 - Work and get things checked off
* Thursday, April 22 (symposium day - no classes)
* Final: Wed., April 28, 8:00 am - 10:00 am - Work and get things checked off

EVERYTHING DUE END OF FINAL 10 am April 28!!!

Project Tasks
-------------

To get 100% on both, this is a total of 16 tasks and 21 calendar days to do them.
Please get them checked off during the five meetings we have left,
(which includes the final time) or make a meeting.

Some of these projects are insanely easy! Like making ASCII art. There is no
excuse not to rack up a bunch of points here.

Please attend class and get these items checked off. If you have to work remote
then make an appointment, or submit as a document. If you have to submit as a
document, make it clear and easy to read. It is a presentation of your work.
Get in the habit of making a good impression.
