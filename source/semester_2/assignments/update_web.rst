Hello everyone,

With COVID and malicious computer outages, things are...weird.

I'm trying to solidify what needs to be done by the end of the year,
so here we go:

CIS 320 Web Development
=======================

Here we are summing up:

* Work left to be done
* Schedule
* What the final project tasks are

Work left to be done
--------------------

All due April 27 at 10 am.

* Insert (past due)
* Delete + Back-end validate (past due)
* Edit record (due Thu Apr 8)
* Login lab (due Tue Apr 27 8 am)

* Rough draft of the report (now due Fri Apr 9)
* Final report (due Tue Apr 27 8 am)

Schedule
--------

I don't know when I'll get a computer and be able to do zoom again.
Definitely not doing a presentation on Thursday. We'll see exactly
what the rest of the sessions bring. There won't be a final, but I'm not sure
if we'll be meeting, or what that meeting will look like yet.

* Thursday, April 8 - Work and get 'edit record' working. Or get caught up if needed.
* Tuesday, April 13 - ?
* Thursday, April 15 - ?
* Tuesday, April 20 - ?
* Thursday, April 22 (symposium day - no classes)
* Final: Tuesday, April 27, 8:00 am - 10:00 am

EVERYTHING DUE END OF FINAL 10 am April 27!!!
