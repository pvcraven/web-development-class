<!-- The head has meta-info about the document that doesn't show up on the
     document, but instead is about the document. Confusingly, many
     documents also have a "header" which is at the top of the document
     and totally different than the head. Also, HTTP, the way we transfer
     HTML over the internet, has its own 'head' section. -->
<head>
  <!-- Specify how the letters are encoded. For Cyrillic, Kanji, Spanish
       characters, etc. The world has mostly standardized on UTF-8, so
       you can use it for about anything. -->

<!-- All things that appear in the document are in the body.
     A document should have only one head, and only one body. Don't put the
     head in the body, or the body on top of the head. That's just weird. -->
