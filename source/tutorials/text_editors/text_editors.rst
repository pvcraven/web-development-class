Text Editors
============

We will be using a **text editor** in class. A text editor is like a word
processor, in that you can use it to type things up. But a text editor doesn't have features
to center text, bold text, or do anything with style. What you type into
a text editor is just that -- text.

Text editors create text files. These are files that just have the letters
you type in. Nothing else.

These text files will make up our web sites. Therefore we need to pick a text editor.
There are two main varieties of text editors. Regular "text editors" and
"Integrated Development Environments." (IDE for short.) An IDE is a text editor with
a lot of built-in tools to help development.

There is a lot of gray area around what is a text editor vs. what is an IDE.
If the program is small, starts fast, and lets you work with individual files,
we call it a text editor. If the program is large, takes a while to start, and
wants you to work in a "project" that manages lots of text files, it is
an IDE.

Text Editors

CSE Validator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`CSE Validator`_ is one of my favorite tools. While it is a decent
text editor, it isn't a great one. The key feature that makes it
stand out that it can check your websites for mistakes.

CSE Validator makes it easy to "validate"
a web page. Web pages can look fine, but have a lot of errors in the code
written to make them work. Just like you can write an English sentence that
people can understand, but might have many grammatical and spelling errors.
CSE Validator helps find the errors in the web code that you write.

It can even check not just one page, but an entire website at once. You hit a button, and it tells you all
your HTML and CSS errors. I have learned a great deal from this tool.

There are several versions of the software
ranging from free to about $350. I personally think the Pro version is worth
the cost. There is an `academic discount`_ if you are a student.

CSE Validator isn't quite as good at editing text as some other options. So
if I do much writing, I will usually open files in different program. Then
test the file later in CSE Validator.

We have CSE Validator in the lab. I'll expect you to "validate" your
websites before turning them in. This will make sure you get all the
points for writing valid HTML and CSS code.

Sublime
^^^^^^^

This is my favorite text editor. You can try it out for free, but to get rid
of the nag-screens you need to pay money. The money is totally worth it.

The most expensive investment is to learn how to use Sublime well.
Sublime can be used
without spending time learning its features, but each feature can save time.

There are many tutorials out there. Here is one to get your started:

Spending an hour doing tutorials on Sublime can save you many hours down the road.
Learning how to use multiple cursors can make life much better.


Atom
^^^^

`Atom`_ is a text editor that is a lot like Sublime. It is slower, but it is free.

Notepad++
^^^^^^^^^

A lot of people like Notepad++ as an editor:

Vim
^^^

If you want a real challenge, learn to use `Vim`_. It is built-in to most Linux computers
and is great if you want to edit text on a remote computer.

Notepad
^^^^^^^

Windows comes with a built-in editor called Notepad. It is terrible. But
it comes with Windows, so I guess it has that going for it.

IDLE
^^^^

IDLE comes with a computer language called Python. If you take a Python course you might be familiar with IDLE.
IDLE is a terrible text editor, and there is no reason to use it when there are so many free options available.

Microsoft Word
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No, don't use this to edit text files. Ever.

Integrated Development Environments
-----------------------------------

JetBrains
^^^^^^^^^

The company JetBrains makes an IDE, but it comes in many "flavors." In my opinion, they have the best IDE out
there right now. As a student, you can get a `free student license <https://www.jetbrains.com/student/>`_ for all
their products. Which product you pick will depend on what primary language you want to do development in:

* WebStorm - JavaScript
* PhpStorm - PHP
* IntelliJ - Java
* PyCharm - Python
* Rider - .NET

For this class, if you want to use JetBrains, I'd recommend IntelliJ or WebStorm.

Eclipse
^^^^^^^

Eclipse_ used to be the standard IDE most people used. Unfortunately it has become kind of slow and bloated with
too many features now. It is free and open-source however.

Visual Studio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Microsoft's `Visual Studio`_ is very popular in places that standardize on a set of tools and languages called .NET.
