Understanding and Choosing Text Editors
=======================================

We will be using a **text editor** in class. A text editor is like a word
processor, in that you can use it to type things up. But a text editor doesn't have features
to center text, bold text, or do anything with style. What you type into
a text editor is just that -- text.

Text editors create text files. These are files that just have the letters
you type in. Nothing else.

These files are what will make up our web sites.

There are many different text editors, we'll talk about some here.

CSE Validator
-------------

`CSE Validator`_ is one of my favorite tools. It makes it easy to "validate"
a web page. Web pages can look fine, but have a lot of errors in the code
written to make them work. Just like you can write an English sentence that
people can understand, but might have many grammatical and spelling errors.
CSE Validator helps find the errors in the web code that you write.

It can even check not just one page, but an entire website at once. You hit a button, and it tells you all
your HTML and CSS errors. I have learned a great deal from this tool.

There are several versions of the software
ranging from free to about $350. I personally think the Pro version is worth
the cost. There is an `academic discount`_ if you are a student.

CSE Validator isn't quite as good at editing text as some other options. So
if I do much writing, I will usually open files in different program. Then
test the file later in CSE Validator.

Sublime
-------

This is my favorite text editor. You can try it out for free, but to get rid
of the nag-screens you need to pay money. The money is totally worth it.

The most expensive investment is to learn how to use Sublime well.
Sublime can be used
without spending time learning its features, but each feature can save time.

There are many tutorials out there. Here is one to get your started:

Atom
----

`Atom`_ is a text editor that is a lot like Sublime. It is slower, but it is free.

Notepad++
---------

A lot of people like Notepad++ as an editor:

Vim
---

If you want a real challenge, learn to use `Vim`_.

Notepad
-------

Windows comes with a built-in editor called Notepad. It is terrible. But
it comes with Windows, so I guess it has that going for it.

IDLE
----

IDLE comes with a computer language called Python. If you take a Python course you might be familiar with IDLE.
IDLE is a terrible text editor, and there is no reason to use it when there are so many free options available.

Microsoft Word
--------------

No, don't use this to edit text files. Ever.
