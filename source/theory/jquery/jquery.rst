For detailed JavaScript tutorials, and as a great reference, see
`W3Schools jQuery <http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp>`_ section.

To get started fast, here are some samples.

Start with a web page ``test_javascript.html``:

.. literalinclude:: test_javascript.html
    :linenos:
    :language: html

In the same directory, create your JavaScript file ``test_javascript.js``:

.. literalinclude:: test_javascript.js
    :linenos:
    :language: javascript
