How to Create DNS Entries
-------------------------

This video shows how to create DNS record entries on AWS.

There are several
`types of DNS records <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types>`_
available. You should know about the following:

* **SOA** - Start of Authority. This is where everything starts. Includes timers
  around the name, primary name server, and other items.
* **NS** - This is a list of all the Name Servers that can be used to look up IP
  addresses for this domain.
* **A** - This record associates a DNS name with an IP address. Or possibly multiple
  IP addresses.
* **CNAME** - This is a canonical name record. It associates this DNS entry with
  another one. Basically an "alias.

How to do DNS Round-Robin
-------------------------

Simple **DNS Round-Robin** entries allow you to specify multiple IP addresses
for the same DNS name. This allows you to distribute load across multiple servers.

How to do Weighted DNS Round-Robin
----------------------------------

What if you have a server that is faster than the other servers? You want twice
as much traffic to go to the fast server as opposed to the slow server? No
problem! You can set up **Weighted DNS Round-Robin** lookups.

How to do Geolocation with DNS
------------------------------

What if you have customers in Europe and in the US? Where do you put your servers?
Why choose? You can put servers in both spots! Use **Geolocation DNS** to select
which DNS records to send based on the customer's location. So a client in Europe
will go to your Ireland server and a client in the US will go to your
Oregon server.

You can also create **failover** record sets, that will make only send out
DNS records for healthy servers. But since DNS entires are cached, it means
that it can take a while for a client to get a new server if one goes down.
It isn't a great way of doing fail over.

Another routing policy is based on **latency**. Latency is the time it takes to
get from the client computer to the server.
It is possible to set up servers in multiple locations, and then give out
a DNS entry for the server that has the lowest latency.

Load Balancers
--------------

Need more options for fail over and load balancing than what the DNS system
provides? Use a **load balancer**. A load balancer will actively monitor and
route traffic between servers. This video shows how to get it set up, but that's
just the tip of the iceberg when looking at what you can do with a load balancer.

Monitoring Services - CloudWatch
--------------------------------

Do you need to be alerted if your server goes down? Starts using too much
CPU? The disk is too busy? Want to see if you can get buy with fewer servers?
See if you need new servers? All of this can be done with the **CloudWatch**
monitoring service.

Content Delivery Network
------------------------

Do you have a lot of static files (files that don't change) that you want
to serve over the web? Like videos, or images? Use a
"**Content Delivery Network**." (CDN)

With AWS, their branded term for CDN is "**CloudFront**." Amazon also has a
service for storing files. This is the **S3** service. You can find this on
your Amazon Console.

This class's entire website is static and can be hosted over a CDN. This video
shows how it is done.

There are four steps to this process:

* Host the files on an Amazon S3 "bucket." A bucket is a simple way to upload
  and serve files without a dedicated web server. At this point, you can
  successfully get your static content, but only from one location. The content
  has not been distributed across the globe.
* Set permissions on the files so anyone can look at them.
* Associate a CloudFront instance to distribute the content in the S3 bucket.
  And then wait several minutes while everything is distributed.
* Create a CNAME record in your DNS to have a friendly URL for your content.
