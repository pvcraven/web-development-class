How To Practice Hacking and Why You Should
------------------------------------------
Ranging from cellphones to vehicles, there is technology all around us.
A majority of people do not know how most of the new technology works.
This leads to most people becoming unaware of the possible ways they can be
negatively exposed by the new technology.

Benjamin Herald [#f1]_ writes about the concern of the shortage of cyber-security
workers in America. One way to solve this problem is to introduce students
to cyber-security-related education during grade school. Less than one-fourth of
high-school seniors have taken a computer science related course. This is
concerning when the world we live in today mainly relies on technology. The
article also mentions how rapidly the field of cyber-security changes and grows.
Programming languages come and go quickly, so the language a student learns in
high school may not be relevant when they apply for jobs in the future. [#f1]_

If a person feels as though they are not getting enough information through their
schooling, or if they are wanting to get started within cyber-security, there are a
tremendous amount of resources online. How To Practice Your Hacking Skills from
TechSolutions [#f2]_ explains in great detail how to practice legal, ethical
hacking. This website also gives a quick rundown of common terms such as white hat
hacking. Ethical hacking consists of trying to exploit one's organization's security,
which is what a true hacker would be doing. The only difference is that the
“White Hat Hacker’s” duty is to protect that information, whereas the
“Black Hat Hacker” tries to expose the organization with the data they collect.

This website also contains multiple domains that help teach some hacking skills
and are available to anyone that can access the internet. A good website that I
have used is HackThisSite.org [#f3]_. Exercises start out easy and get more
difficult the further you work on the website. It has you find a password for each
level that is somewhere hidden within the website. Here are the other domains
listed on this website.

* ``bWAPP``
* ``Buggy Web Application``
* ``Google Gruyere``
* ``HackThis!!``
* ``Hack This Site``
* ``Game of Hacks``
* ``Vicnum``
* ``McAfee HacMe Sites``
* ``Try2Hack``
* ``OverTheWire``
* ``Mutillidae``
* ``Root Me``
* ``Peruggia``
* ``WebGoat``

A helpful book from the Dunn Library, The Basics of Hacking and Penetration
Testing: Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing Made Easy [#f4]_ talks about the
different free tools that help with hacking and are available to anyone. A good
start to learn how to hack is to become knowledgeable with Linux. This
book will introduce you to the different software and walk you through how to
start with a Kali or BackTrack machine, which are both Linux operated. The book
also goes into the details of writing a pen test report for a client. This is a
step by step process of what the hacker has figured out from the penetration test.

I also was able to watch a video from USENIX Enigma's Conference [#f5]_ that was
not revolved around learning how to work in cyber-security, but rather how a
cyber-security team can operate to improve their performance. The speaker compared
the Secret Service to the job of a cyber-security worker. There is always a chance
that someone will try to break into the White House, just like there is always a
chance a person will try to break into a company’s internal infrastructure. The
professionals are more concerned about the response time and what happens when
they do find an intruder. They also want to focus on restricting the possibility
of easily maneuvering through the server and gaining access to the entire server.

In conclusion, there is a need for workers within cyber-security. There are plenty
of resources available to the public that can help anyone strengthen their skills
for a job in this field. Ranging from websites online, or books in a library,
a little bit of effort in learning something new can possibly lead to a rewarding
job. It is important to know how to stay safe in today's world.
